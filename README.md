## MAD Dashboard For Chat bot Conversations (Sentiment Analysis)
With Covid19 sweeping across, taking down regular business operations, most organizations are resorting to online storefront and customer service approach that leverages use of Chat bots to help serve customer request. Chat bots well known to handle heavy customer volume, but are also equally know to be unreliable at times to respond correctly to the customer's request.

This Project's purpose is to capture various customer emotions as they converse with the Chat bot and scan for any anger or distress emotion signalling that customer is not satisfied with the Chat bot. The manager or customer service representative will be alerted of the negative emotions through a dashboard, allowing them to jump in and take control of the situation.
